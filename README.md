# CS1410 Assignment 03 - Shapes

Name: Subhanjan Bikram KC

This repo contains my submission for CS1410 Assignment 03.
The program implements:
- ShapeKind enum
- Shape struct
- area(), perimeter(), nameOf(), promptAndReadInputFor()
- Main function prints a formatted table

Instructions:
1. Compile src/assignment03.cpp
2. Run the executable

Build and run (CMake):
1. cd /workspaces/Assignment-3-Backup/assignment-3-backup
2. mkdir -p build
3. cd build
4. cmake ..
5. make assignment03
6. ./assignment03

Note: I was not able to log into GitHub Classroom. To avoid losing any grades,
I created a private repo and completed the assignment here. I emailed you the
GitHub repo link and will try to fix the Classroom issue as soon as possible.
For now, I want to show that I completed the homework by myself and do not want
to lose any grades.
